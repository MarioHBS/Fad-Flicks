### Naming the App

I tried to find a unique name to this application. I thought of PoMos, but that would be misleading or
incomprehensible or "making them think is this guy crazy?". So I checked for synonyms for popular and movies.
Turns out Fad and Flicks kind of stick together. Ugh but this is not what I learnt in this project.

### What did I learn?

### Android stuff
* AsyncTasks.
* Fragments. Just a little.
* Network calls.
* SharedPreferences.
* GridView. After all not that scary.
* CustomAdapters.
* Using Open-source libraries.
* Coordinator layout and about scroll flags
* A bit about Material design.
* SnackBars.

### Non-Android stuff
* Git. Seriously, I feel more comfortable with it now. There is a lot to learn though.
* Debugging. Instead of creating hundreds of log messages better use the built-in android studio debugger.
* How to properly edit README.md file.
* I'll add more later.
